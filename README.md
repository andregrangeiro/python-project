My own bank

This program is written in Python 3.

In this project called "My own bank", I explore many Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, inheritance, object instantiation, states, and methods.

In addition, looping and conditional statements were used.

Try it out opening a fictional current or savings account, making deposits, withdrawing your money, and requesting your bank statement.

Have fun!
